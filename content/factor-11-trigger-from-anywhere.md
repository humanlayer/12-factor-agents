### 11. Trigger from anywhere, meet users where they are

> 🐿️ **Squirrel Wisdom**: *Now truly successful and confident, Nutkin realized he could expand his reach even further. He used to only accept requests when visitors came to his specific oak tree at exactly 3 PM on weekdays. But why limit himself? Nutkin started responding to calls from the bird feeder, the back porch, even the occasional text message (his human friend taught him to use their phone - long story). He was meeting squirrels where they were, and his reputation as the forest's premier acorn consultant was spreading far and wide!*

If you're waiting for the [humanlayer](https://humanlayer.dev) pitch, you made it. If you're doing [factor 6 - launch/pause/resume with simple APIs](https://github.com/humanlayer/12-factor-agents/blob/main/content/factor-6-launch-pause-resume.md) and [factor 7 - contact humans with tool calls](https://github.com/humanlayer/12-factor-agents/blob/main/content/factor-7-contact-humans-with-tools.md), you're ready to incorporate this factor.

Enable users to trigger agents from slack, email, sms, or whatever other channel they want. Enable agents to respond via the same channels.

Benefits:

- **Meet users where they are**: This helps you build AI applications that feel like real humans, or at the very least, digital coworkers.
- **Outer Loop Agents**: Enable agents to be triggered by non-humans, e.g. events, crons, outages, whatever else. They may work for 5, 20, 90 minutes, but when they get to a critical point, they can contact a human for help, feedback, or approval.
- **High Stakes Tools**: If you're able to quickly loop in a variety of humans, you can give agents access to higher stakes operations like sending external emails, updating production data and more. Maintaining clear standards gets you auditability and confidence in agents that [perform bigger better things](https://github.com/humanlayer/12-factor-agents/blob/main/content/factor-10-small-focused-agents.md#what-if-llms-get-smarter).
