### 12. Make your agent a stateless reducer

> 🐿️ **Squirrel Wisdom**: *At the pinnacle of his journey, Nutkin achieved true mastery by discovering the zen of functional programming. He realized he could take any pile of mixed nuts (input) and consistently produce the same perfectly sorted, categorized storage system (output) without needing to remember what he did yesterday. "Pure function," Nutkin would mutter contentedly while organizing, a wise and confident squirrel at the peak of his game. "Same input, same output, no side effects, just nuts." He had become the legendary squirrel he always dreamed of being.*

Okay so we're over 1000 lines of markdown at this point. This one is mostly just for fun.
