12-Factor Agents - Principles for building reliable LLM applications
In the spirit of 12 Factor Apps

What are the principles we can use to build LLM-powered software that is actually good enough to put in the hands of production customers?
Welcome to 12-factor agents.

The Short Version: The 12 Factors
Even if LLMs continue to get exponentially more powerful, there will be core engineering techniques that make LLM-powered software more reliable, more scalable, and easier to maintain.

How We Got Here: A Brief History of Software

Factor 1: Natural Language to Tool Calls

Factor 2: Own your prompts

Factor 3: Own your context window

Factor 4: Tools are just structured outputs

Factor 5: Unify execution state and business state

Factor 6: Launch/Pause/Resume with simple APIs

Factor 7: Contact humans with tool calls

Factor 8: Own your control flow

Factor 9: Compact Errors into Context Window

Factor 10: Small, Focused Agents

Factor 11: Trigger from anywhere, meet users where they are

Factor 12: Make your agent a stateless reducer

Why 12-Factor Agents?
After working with many AI builders and founders, one pattern stood out:

The fastest way to get high-quality LLM-powered software in production is not through full agent frameworks, but by modularly integrating agentic principles into existing systems.

Design Patterns for Great LLM Applications
The key insight: modular patterns from agent architectures can massively improve quality and maintainability without requiring wholesale rewrites.

Honorable Mentions
Factor 13: Pre-fetch all the context you might need
